# Create and verify User resource workflow
- defaultTab: output
  description: |-
    Create a User resource and verify it was created successfully.
    Steps: create-user -> describe-user
    The create step forces JSON output so the child job can capture the
    resource name via export-var, making it available to the describe step
    as ${export.resource_name}.
